SmartVision Engine: Adaptive Detection & Automated Retraining Pipeline
SmartVision Engine is an advanced computer vision framework designed for iterative object recognition. It leverages a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) approach, allowing users to validate and correct AI detections in real-time to trigger an automated model evolution.
